# CropPrediction
###  **ASCII : Future of Smart Agriculture**
An IOT based smart farm which aims to help farmers in multifolding their yields and protect their crops from damage.
The farmers will be able to use AI to decide which crop to grow according to changing climate. 
The model used for the prediction of the crops takes pH, rainfall, humidity and temperature as input parameters(from the sensors).
<br/><br/> The model used for the prediction is RandomForestClassifier with test accuracy being 91%

Tech Stack Used - Python, ML, Flask, HTML, CSS
